            <p>After graduating high school, I was a typical teen about to go into college wondering if the major I
                had
                chosen, Kinesiology, was right for me. I did not feel certain about it and was hoping I would find
                another career path as soon as possible. Luckily, a month before my first semester of
                college, I
                had been introduced to coding through my sister's friend, a self-taught programmer.
                His story fueled me
                to teach myself code and change my major to Computer Science. Even though I knew I could possibly
                learn web development in school, I did not want to wait around to embark on this journey of being
                a
                software engineer when I knew it was possible to teach myself if I worked hard enough.
                So, I bought
                courses and other essentials in order to teach myself the core fundamentals of web development. I spent
                as much time as possible
                learning to code after school, in between classes, and sometimes during classes such as my CompSci 110
                class :) . I
                became hooked as soon as I saw the first lines of HTML and fell in love once the complexity was
                added
                with programming
                languages such as Javascript. I enjoyed continuously learning about new technologies and the feeling of
                triumph when figuring out the solution to a persisting problem, even if the problem was as miniscule as
                implementing the wrong type of brackets.
                Now, I hope to continue to expand my knowledge of other languages and of the best practices when it
                comes
                to
                web development. I
                am currently looking for an opportunity to hone my skills in a professional setting and become a
                valuable asset to a team.
